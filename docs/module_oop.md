# OOP questions

## Software design

### Error handling

#### What does 'fail fast' mean in terms of exception handling? Why is it a good practice?
>Fail fast means,  is to code your software such that, when there is a problem,
>the software fails as soon as and as visibly as possible,
>rather than trying to proceed in a possibly unstable state.
